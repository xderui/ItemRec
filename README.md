# ItemRec

ItemRec(Item Perspective Recommendation) is a re-ranking framework which enables items "select" users.  Our experiments are conducted based on [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole).

The implementation of our method can be found in `ItemRec.ipynb` 

## Update
a new optimized version `ItemRec_optimized.ipynb` with higher execution efficiency. Just rewrote the code, the execution logic remains unchanged
